# Plotly

## Purpose of Project
Using my knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. I created a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage. I created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
